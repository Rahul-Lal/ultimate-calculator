<b>09/04/2019</b>: Initated web calculator project & respository on Github<br>
<b>10/04/2019</b>: Successfully get calculator to work all functions via tutorial video, now my imagination must lead the rest of the way<br>
<b>20/10/2019</b>: Restarting project via new branch 'Redo-21-10-2019' for fresher perspective'<br>
<b>21/10/2019</b>: Completed calculator with all four functions (add, subract, multiply delete) to work<br>
<b>22/10/2019</b>: Numeral buttons are working on branch 'numeral-buttons-22-10-2019', appears it doesn't on textboxes considering they're inputs. But does work on header (h2), this would be the 'textbox' from now one<br>
